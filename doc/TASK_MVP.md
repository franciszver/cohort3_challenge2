## 🛠️ **Environment Setup Commands**

### Required Tools Installation:

```bash
# 1. Node.js (download from nodejs.org)
node --version  # Verify installation
npm --version   # Should be included with Node.js

# 2. Expo CLI
npm install -g @expo/cli
expo --version  # Verify installation

# 3. AWS CLI & Amplify CLI
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
amplify configure  # Set up AWS credentials
