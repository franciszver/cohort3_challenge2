## 🛠️ **Environment Setup Commands**

### Required Tools Installation:

```bash
# 1. Node.js (download from nodejs.org)
node --version  # Verify installation
npm --version   # Should be included with Node.js

# 2. Expo CLI
npm install -g @expo/cli
expo --version  # Verify installation

# 3. AWS CLI & Amplify CLI
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
amplify configure  # Set up AWS credentials

# 4. Optional but recommended
npm install -g yarn  # Alternative package manager
```

### Initial Project Setup:

```bash
# Create new Expo project
npx create-expo-app ChatAppMVP --template expo-template-blank-typescript

# Navigate to project
cd ChatAppMVP

# Install core dependencies
npm install @aws-amplify/react-native aws-amplify
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

# For Expo managed workflow
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

## 📊 **Milestone Checkpoints**

Based on the Implementation Plan, here are key checkpoints to ensure you're on track:

### **Hour 12 Checkpoint**: Basic messaging must be working
- ✅ Tasks 1-16 should be completed
- ✅ Users can authenticate and send/receive messages in real-time

### **Hour 24 Checkpoint**: Group chat and real-time features operational
- ✅ Tasks 1-25 should be completed
- ✅ Group messaging, read receipts, and presence indicators working

### **Hour 34 Checkpoint**: MVP ready for deployment
- ✅ All tasks completed except final testing and deployment prep
- ✅ All core features functional and polished

## 🎯 **Key Technical Decisions**

- **Amplify UI Components**: Use pre-built auth components to save development time
- **GraphQL Code Generation**: Leverage Amplify's auto-generated client for type safety  
- **State Management**: Use React Context + useReducer for chat state (simple, fast setup)
- **Message Caching**: Implement simple local storage for offline persistence
- **Real-time Strategy**: Primary focus on GraphQL subscriptions, WebSocket fallback if needed

## 🔄 **Commit Strategy**

Each task should result in **one focused commit**:

- **Task 1-3**: Environment setup commits
- **Task 4-8**: Foundation and backend setup commits  
- **Task 9-12**: UI and navigation commits
- **Task 13-19**: Core messaging feature commits
- **Task 20-25**: Advanced feature commits
- **Task 26-30**: Polish and optimization commits
- **Task 31-35**: Testing and deployment commits

**Commit Message Format**:
```
